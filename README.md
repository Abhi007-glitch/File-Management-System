# File-Management-System

Tried making a windows like File Management-system using **Vanilla Javascrip**.
To deal with text file Builded a text-editor and added CURD (create,Update,Read,Delete) functionality to it. Also added a functionality to download the file loaclly.
Similary to deal with media file added Album functionality.
