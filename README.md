# File-Management-System

Tried making a **File Management-system** using **Vanilla Javascript**.  

Added a **Breadcrumb** to show the directory path and acess the diffrent sub-directory added to the path direclty using breadcrumb.

To deal with text file **builded a text-editor** and added **CURD** (create,Update,Read,Delete) functionality to it. Also added a functionality to **download the file locally**.

Similary to deal with media file added **Album** functionality.

Many more features to be added soon.
